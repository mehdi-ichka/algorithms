Backtracking:
 - solve permutation problems
 - brute force scan of the whole dataset
 - use bounding function to eliminate invalid arrangements
 - uses space state tree (tree of all possible arrangements)
 - uses depth traversal

DynamicProgramming:
 - solve optimization problems (using precalculated values in memory-hash tables in most cases)

GreedyMethod:
 - solve maximizing problems

Branch'nBound:
 - solve minimizing problems
 - uses space state tree (tree of all possible arrangements)
 - uses upperBound and Cost to eliminate invalid arrangements
 - uses level order traversal
 - uses one of 3 the methods: LIFO, FIFO, MINIMAL COST
